abstract = {It is first shown that the time at which a moving classical particle reaches a fixed space point can be measured with arbitrarily high precision by the use of a suitably conceived apparatus. The same apparatus is then imagined to be exposed to a moving nonrelativistic quantum particle. Von Neumann's theory of quantum measurements is adapted to cover cases like this, in which pieces of information from the measurement process accumulate in the registration stages of the apparatus over an extended period of time. The relevant Schrödinger equation is solved. It is found that the apparatus fails to fulfill its designed purpose if its resolution time is too small. This implies an extension of the uncertainty principle and of the principle of complementarity—there are dynamical variables in classical particle mechanics which even singly admit no perfectly defined quantal counterparts. The status of the particle concept in the interpretation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is discussed in the light of these findings.}

Their expected values are connected with the point (x1, x2, t) on the plane Q in which the particle passes through Q. The operator t̂Q is used to formulate the realistic interpretation of the uncertainty relation Δt · ΔE ⩾ ħ/2. This interpretation is related to the possibility of preparing quantum states with the help of macroscopic (classical) instruments.}

abstract = {We propose a formulation of an absorbing boundary for a quantum particle. The formulation is based on a Feynman-type integral over trajectories that are confined to the non-absorbing region. Trajectories that reach the absorbing wall are discounted from the population of the surviving trajectories with a certain weighting factor. Under the assumption that absorbed trajectories do not interfere with the surviving trajectories, we obtain a time-dependent absorption law. Two examples are worked out.}

abstract={Solution of fractional differential equations is an emerging area of present day research because such equations arise in various applied fields. In this paper we have developed analytical method to solve the system of fractional differential equations in-terms of Mittag-Leffler function and generalized Sine and Cosine functions, where the fractional derivative operator is of Jumarie type. The use of Jumarie type fractional derivative, which is modified Rieman-Liouvellie fractional derivative, eases the solution to such fractional order systems. The use of this type of Jumarie fractional derivative gives a conjugation with classical methods of solution of system of linear integer order differential equations, by usage of Mittag-Leffler and generalized trigonometric functions. The ease of this method and its conjugation to classical method to solve system of linear fractional differential equation is appealing to researchers in fractional dynamic systems. Here after developing the method, the algorithm is applied in physical system of fractional differential equation. The analytical results obtained are then graphically plotted for several examples for system of linear fractional differential equation.},

abstract = {There has recently been a growth in interest in electron tunnelling through barriers, and in particular in the question of whether it is possible to talk of a tunnelling time and, if so, what is it? A brief account of a study of the signal velocity of wavepackets travelling into a rectangular barrier was given recently, and the present paper is an extended version of this theory. In particular it is shown that the signal velocity of a free electron is the same as its group velocity, which in turn is the same as that which a classical particle particle of the same energy would have. It is also shown that when the wavepacket enters a classically forbidden region the signal velocity continues to have a meaning, and indeed a pulse-like wavefunction travels very much like a light pulse in a dispersive and attenuating medium. The expression for the signal velocity is symmetrical with respect to the barrier height, so that pulses well below the barrier travel faster, though with greater attenuation, than pulses near the top of the barrier. This result agrees with conclusions reached by some other workers. It is also shown that an electron responds to an accelerating field in the barrier as would be expected for a classical particle. It is argued that the not uncommon statement that the non nor eigenstates of a free particle describe a beam of particles is incorrect for electrons, for such a solution can at most describe two electrons. The theory indicates that by using orthogonal wavepackets it is possible to construct many-electron wavefunctions which do describe beams of electrons, and then free electrons travel with the group (and signal) velocity.}
